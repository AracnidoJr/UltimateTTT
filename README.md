The objective of this project is to develop an AI program capable of playing Meta Tic Tac Toe based on the Minimax algorithm. With this objective in mind, an action plan is developed in three phases. 

Data structure design: Includes the creation of the boards where the game information is stored.

Game design: Understands the implementation of the Meta Tic Tac Toe game rules and the code used to play. 

Minimax strategy design: It includes the development of the heuristic strategy used for the evaluation of movements so that the machine can play.
